## Project Description
BorrowBox is a campus-focused web application that allows students to **borrow, lend, sell, and report lost or found items** in one place.  
The system also includes a **chat feature** that enables users to communicate directly with sellers or lenders, making coordination easier and faster.

## The Problem Statement

Students often face problems such as:

- Losing items on campus with no proper recovery system
